I'VE CHANGED THE PLANS!!!!!

Why:
I've been troubleshooting learning graphics for like 2 weeks.
I've worked on some structures of the logic classes.
Then I sent the emil (you remember) and you said not only was it fine but that I could probably do better without graphics
  This is when the plans changed.
  
New class structures. ---------------------

Main class
  - runs everything
  - methods
    - menu
      - will contain options that string from the menu
      - I will only start with the "play game option" and do more features if I have time
      - will launch into the game and other feathers from a switch
    - play
      - launches the game
      - initiatalizes the board from the logic class
      - will do 3 things, in this order
        - draw the board
        - accept input
        - check if winning conditions are met
Logic class
  - same as before
  -"drawing" (printing) will be done here
  - will hold the board array
  - new methods
    - draw board
