----------------------------------------
components of connect 4

- stacking on inputted collums
- types of wins
	- horizontal 
	- vertical
	- diagonally (positive y=x /)
	- diagonally (negative y=-x \)
- stopping at the top
- the board
	- 7x6
- differenciate between 2 player's colours

-----------------------------------
conponens of the rest of the progarm

- intro screen
- option to exit
- mouse controll
- graphics
- need to do it OOP for good marks

---------------------------------------------
setup of methods, classes, behaviours, and properties

there will be an Enum of the colours
	
class - board
	Properties + description
		- will be the class where information is stored
		- a pre created object will be the board with each collum as it's own list of integers
		- ArrayList<ArrayList<colour>> field = new ArrayList<ArrayList<colour>>();
		
	Behaviours
		- check win
			- will check if a player has won in all directions
			- will stay efficient and only check a if there enough pieces in the row/collum/diagonal for any player to have won
			
		- draw piece
			- will draw a piece to the correct spot on the board

class player
	properties
		- Name (string)
		- Colour (enum)
	behaviours
		- set name (String)
			- sets the name of the string
		- set colour (enum)

class create
will have a premade class called draw
	properties
		- TBD
	behaviours
		- draw board
		- draw piece (enum, position x, position y)
			draws the coloured piece in the correct spot
		- draw text (String)
			draws little letters
		- draw title (String)
			draws big letters
		
			
		

--------------------------------------------------------
things to do if I have time

- single player (I have to make a connect 4 ai)
- animatted piece dropping
- 3 player connect 3
- customizable player identification
- text doc to remember scores and stats for each player
