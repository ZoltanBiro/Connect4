---------------------------------------------
setup of classes, behaviours, and properties

class - board
		Properties + description
		- will be the class where information is stored
		- a pre created object will be the board with each collum as it's own list of integers
		- 1 for player 1, 2 for player 2, 0 for not occupied
		
	Behaviours
		- check win
			- will check if a player has won in all directions
			- will stay efficient and only check a if there enough pieces in the row/collum/diagonal for any player to have won
			
		- draw piece
			- will draw a piece to the correct spot on the board



--------------------------------------------------------
things to do if I have time

- single player (I have to make a connect 4 ai)
- animatted piece dropping
- 3 player connect 3
